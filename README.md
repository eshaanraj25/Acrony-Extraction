# Video Categorization

In the era of growing technology, there is so much content available on the internet. Anybody can easily access this content available online. Not all of this content is suitable for all age groups

In our project, we have dealt with such videos available online. Here, we are categorizing the videos into different age groups for which they are suitable based on the NSFW content in the video and the text analysis on the transcribed audio present in the video. The results are calculated based on several sets of conditions so that the distinction for the age groups is well defined.

The project uses Python and TensorFlow. We have used the various frames present in the videos for depicting the NSFW content present in the video-based upon the Yahoo NSFW model re-written in TensorFlow. Yahooâ€™s NSFW Model has been used to identify whether or not an image or frame is suitable for a particular age group. Next, we have also used abusive or hate text analysis or detection based on the transcribed audio extracted from the given video. After analyzing both the frames and the transcribed audio, the outcome, or the desired age group is defined for that particular video.

The project provides different filters on the videos classifying them according to the restricted age group for which they are safe. This will in turn help in creating a healthy and safe platform online and prevent people from accessing or indulging in content that may be harmful to them.
